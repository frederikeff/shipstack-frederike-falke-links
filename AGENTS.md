### Git Workflow
1. Create feature branch: `feature/feature-name`
2. Implement feature with tests
3. Commit with clear messages
4. Push to branch
5. AI will test and merge to main

### API Guidelines
- RESTful endpoints
- Proper HTTP status codes
- JSON responses
- Error responses with helpful messages
- Input validation

### Database

Single-page static site with vibrant dark yellow background and pink/purple accents, featuring profile section, project links with images, Creative AI Lab grid categories, and contact email

No backend required - fully static site with hardcoded content and external links
